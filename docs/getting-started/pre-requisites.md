# Pre-requisites

NRN expects the following to be already installed on your computer:

- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage installed Nodejs versions (allow to switch between versions)
    - It's not really a requirement, but a good practice for any serious developer.
    - If you don't use NVM, then please use node `v12` for the next steps. [Learn why](../guides/online-deployment/use-zeit)
- Node.js should be installed (it's installed by NVM, so you're probably already covered)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) will be necessary to clone the repository on your computer.

As you can see, there is no particular dependency to use NRN, all those tools are probably already installed on your computer!

> NRN has only been extensively tested on **MacOS Catalina**, we expect **Unix-based OS** to behave properly, but **Windows** may behave differently (it shouldn't, but hasn't been tested).
