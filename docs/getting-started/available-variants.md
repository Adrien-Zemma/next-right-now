## Showcases - Live demo

You can see 2 almost identical demo at:
- [https://nrn-customer1.now.sh](https://nrn-customer1.now.sh)
- [https://nrn-customer2.now.sh](https://nrn-customer2.now.sh)

**Both share the same source code and configuration**, but the database content is different (hosted on GraphCMS).

> **Tip**: You can get metadata at [/api/status](https://nrn-customer1.now.sh/api/status)
>
> **Tip**: All `/api/*` are serverless functions, running under AWS Lambda
