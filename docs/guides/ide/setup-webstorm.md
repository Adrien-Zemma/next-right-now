# How to setup WebStorm IDE

- Configure your IDE not to index `.next` and `.now` folders as they will eat a lot of your RAM because their files are changed very frequently!
    - On WebStorm, right click on the folders and select `Mark directory as > Excluded`.

- You can start the project in **debug mode** (built-in for WebStorm only) [by running the WebStorm "Debug" configuration in debug mode](https://youtu.be/3vbkiRAT4e8)
