# I18n (Internationalization)

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
**Internationalization**, often abbreviated as i18n, is the process through which products can be prepared to be taken to other countries.
It doesnâ€™t just mean being able to change languages.
Instead, it means being able to accept different forms of data, different settings to match local customs and different strings of data and process it correctly.

**Localization** (l10n) is simply the act of changing a piece of software to suit a different locale.

> In many ways, internationalization can be thought of as building the structure of a piece of software so that it can be adjusted for different markets,
>and localization is the process of actually doing so for a specific market.

We will only mention i18n with NRN, not l10n.
Both are very similar and can be grouped together as i18n, because l10n relies on i18n capabilities.

The content displayed on NRN is translated using different ways, depending on where the translations are stored:
- Dynamic i18n - Content-related (i.e: Post title in FR + EN). It will depend on your data and how you fetch those data (API, SSG, etc.)
- Static i18n - Everything that isn't related to dynamic content (i.e: Site links, any content that is static and not related to dynamic data).
It will depend on how you fetch those data (vendor (API), i18n static files, etc.)

It is possible, although very rare, to use the same system/vendor for both "dynamic" and "static" i18n.

For instance, one could imagine to store all its static content within it's dynamic i18n content. This design would have a few pros/cons:
- Content is available online (CMS/back office) and may be updated by non-IT teams
- Content needs to be fetched for each request (SSR), but that could be mitigated by using SSG

## A few words on "static i18n"

I18n with Next.js isn't an easy topic, and our current implementation with static content (Locize vendor) isn't optimal.

In short, we believe the best way to deal with static i18n is to use SSG. We currently use SSR, which is definitely sub-optimal and impacts performances and costs.

### How to get it right

Basically, the process could be to fetch your i18n content at build time and generate your pages once and for all.
This avoids over-fetching your i18n provider for each end-user request, and also remove this vendor from the potential list of threats of your app.
(even if your vendor API goes down, it won't affect your end-users because you only use its API at build time)

Such design also has various benefits and limitations. For example, you can't change static content without rebuilding your app,
but it also increases the speed of your pages because you don't have to fetch static content anymore.

It can be complicated to achieve depending on your needs and limitations, and will be impacted by how many pages you have to build, for instance.

## A few words on "dynamic i18n"

**Dynamic i18n** is a bit more easier in our opinion.
If you need those data dynamically, then you'll have to use your vendor API to fetch the i18n content,
the same way you're using its API to fetch non-i18n data.

But SSG is becoming very attractive in 2020, and most sites **don't actually need to perform real-time requests** to fetch up-to-date content.
You may be able to use SSG there as well, and build your static pages at build time.

There is no bullet-proof-fit-them-all solution on this, it depends on your requirements and limitations.

> The one thing to keep in mind, is that **i18n is dependant on how your render your app**, and that has many, complex implications. (SSR, SSG, etc.)
